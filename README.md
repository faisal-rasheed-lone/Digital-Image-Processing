# Digital Image Processing Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python programs and Jupyter notebooks focused on digital image processing techniques using OpenCV and other libraries. These files cover fundamental and advanced methods, including bitwise operations, video capture, object detection, thresholding techniques, and more.

## Getting Started

To run the programs, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for some of the notebooks)

Install required libraries with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Digital-Image-Processing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Digital-Image-Processing
   ```
3. Run any of the Python files using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
4. For Jupyter notebooks, open them in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook environment.
