## Getting Started

To run the programs, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for some of the notebooks)

Install required libraries with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Digital-Image-Processing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Digital-Image-Processing
   ```
3. Run any of the Python files using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
4. For Jupyter notebooks, open them in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook environment.
